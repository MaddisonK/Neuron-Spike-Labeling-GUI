# Nueron-Spike-Labeling-GUI
I completed this project for the Neural Engineering Laboratory to make labeling neuron spike traces easier 
by creating a GUI that could label spikes with two degrees of certainty.

The code can be run by downloading the .py file and running it in the command line by executing the command `python Spike_Marker.py`.

The input file will be "trace.npz", which can be downloaded as an example file in this repository, but any npz file in as similar format should work or can be easily modified to work. 

The program collects the labels from the GUI in two python lists `main list` and `dub list`, printing them out at the end, but they can be easily converted and saved as npz files.

I hope you find this GUI useful and easy to use! A demonstration of it is below.
