# Nueron-Spike-Labeling-GUI
I completed this project for the Neural Engineering Laboratory to make labeling neuron spike traces easier 
by creating a GUI that could label spikes with two degrees of certainty.

The code can be run by downloading the .py file and running it in the command line by executing the command `python Spike_Marker.py`.
